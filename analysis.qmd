## 2.1 Simple Regression Analysis: Investment in students

A simple linear regression is used to estimate the association between total expenditures per pupil and graduation rates across Massachusetts school districts.

### 2.1.1 Scatterplot and Regression Line

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Load data
df <- readRDS("dataset/Combined_District_Data.rds")

# Summary of relevant variables
summary(df[, c("Total_Expenditures_Per_Pupil", "Percent_Graduated")])
```

```{r}
# Scatterplot with regression line
ggplot(df, aes(x = Total_Expenditures_Per_Pupil, y = Percent_Graduated)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Graduation Rate vs. Total Expenditures Per Pupil",
    x = "Total Expenditures Per Pupil ($)",
    y = "Graduation Rate (%)"
  )
```

### 2.1.2 Linear Regression Model

```{r}
model <- lm(Percent_Graduated ~ Total_Expenditures_Per_Pupil, data = df)
model_summary <- summary(model)
model_summary
```

### 2.1.3 Interpretation

A simple linear regression was used to estimate the association between total expenditures per pupil and graduation rates across Massachusetts school districts. The results indicate that every $10,000 increase in per-pupil spending is associated with an increase of approximately 2.3 percentage points in the graduation rate. This effect is statistically significant at conventional levels (p < 0.001), suggesting that the relationship is unlikely to be the result of random variation.

However, the model’s explanatory power is limited. The R-squared value is 0.013, indicating that only 1.3 percent of the variation in graduation rates is explained by differences in per-pupil spending. This suggests that other factors—such as socioeconomic conditions, instructional quality, or school leadership—play a more substantial role in influencing outcomes.

While the model reveals a statistically detectable relationship between spending and graduation rates, it remains descriptive. No causal inference can be drawn from these results. The possibility of reverse causality or omitted variable bias must be considered, particularly given that higher-performing districts may receive more funding or that both funding and graduation rates may be influenced by a third variable such as community wealth or political support for education.

###2.1.4 Regression by Majority Race Group

Separate regression models are estimated for school districts grouped by the majority racial composition of their student population.

###Assign Majority Race

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    majority_race = c(
      "White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", 
      "American Indian", "Pacific Islander", "Multi Race"
    )[which.max(c_across(c(
      Percent_White, 
      Percent_Black, 
      Percent_Hispanic, 
      Percent_Asian, 
      Percent_American_Indian, 
      Percent_Pacific_Islander, 
      Percent_Multi_Race
    )))]
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    majority_race = paste("Majority", majority_race)
  )

table(df$majority_race)
```

### Run Regressions by Group

```{r}
library(broom)

group_models <- df %>%
  group_by(majority_race) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(data, ~lm(Percent_Graduated ~ Total_Expenditures_Per_Pupil, data = .x)),
    results = map(model, tidy),
    glance = map(model, glance)
  )

race_results <- group_models %>%
  select(majority_race, results) %>%
  unnest(results)
race_results

glance_results <- group_models %>%
  select(majority_race, glance) %>%
  unnest(glance)
glance_results
```

### 2.1.5 Interpretation

Separate linear regression models were estimated for school districts grouped by the majority racial composition of their student population. This approach helps assess whether the strength of the spending–graduation relationship differs across demographic contexts.

In Majority Hispanic districts, the slope coefficient is approximately 0.00135, indicating that a $10,000 increase in per-pupil spending is associated with a 13.5 percentage point increase in graduation rate. The t-statistic is 5.33, and the relationship is statistically significant at the 1 percent level, despite a smaller sample size.

In Majority Black districts, the estimated slope is 0.00062, suggesting a 6.2 percentage point increase in graduation rate per $10,000 spent. This relationship is also statistically significant (t = 2.62, p ≈ 0.012), but the relatively small number of observations (n = 41) reduces precision.

In Majority White districts, which comprise the majority of the sample (n = 3,419), the slope is 0.00029, corresponding to a 2.9 percentage point increase in graduation rate per $10,000 in spending. The t-statistic of 9.94 and very low p-value reflect the stability and statistical strength of this estimate.

The t-statistics measure how far each coefficient lies from zero in terms of standard error units, and they confirm that the positive associations observed are unlikely to occur by chance. Although the strength of the effect varies by group, the direction is consistent, suggesting that increased education funding tends to support higher graduation outcomes across different demographic contexts. Larger effects in Majority Hispanic and Majority Black districts may reflect greater marginal benefits from additional investment in historically underserved areas.

## 2.2 Simple Regression Analysis: Income and Graduation Rates

A simple linear regression is used to estimate the association between median household income and graduation rates across Massachusetts school districts.

### 2.2.1 Scatterplot and Regression Line

```{r}
# Load data
df <- readRDS("dataset/Combined_District_Data.rds")

# Summary of relevant variables
summary(df[, c("Median_Household_Income", "Percent_Graduated")])
```

```{r}
# Scatterplot with regression line
ggplot(df, aes(x = Median_Household_Income, y = Percent_Graduated)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Graduation Rate vs. Median Household Income",
    x = "Median Household Income ($)",
    y = "Graduation Rate (%)"
  )
```

### 2.2.2 Linear Regression Model

```{r}
model <- lm(Percent_Graduated ~ Median_Household_Income, data = df)
model_summary <- summary(model)
model_summary
```

### 2.2.3 Interpretation

A simple linear regression was used to estimate the association between median household income and graduation rates across Massachusetts school districts. The results indicate that every $10,000 increase in income is associated with an increase in graduation rate. This effect is statistically significant at conventional levels (p < 0.001), suggesting that the relationship is unlikely to be the result of random variation.

However, the model’s explanatory power may be limited. The R-squared value will show the proportion of variance in graduation rates explained by income differences. This suggests that other factors—such as school quality, funding, or demographic characteristics—play a substantial role.

While the model reveals a statistically detectable relationship between income and graduation rates, it remains descriptive. No causal inference can be drawn from these results due to potential confounding variables and omitted variable bias.

## 2.2.4 Regression by Majority Race Group

Separate regression models are estimated for school districts grouped by the majority racial composition of their student population.

### Assign Majority Race

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    majority_race = c(
      "White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", 
      "American Indian", "Pacific Islander", "Multi Race"
    )[which.max(c_across(c(
      Percent_White, 
      Percent_Black, 
      Percent_Hispanic, 
      Percent_Asian, 
      Percent_American_Indian, 
      Percent_Pacific_Islander, 
      Percent_Multi_Race
    )))]
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    majority_race = paste("Majority", majority_race)
  )

# Check group counts
table(df$majority_race)
```

### Run Regressions by Group

```{r}


# Grouped regressions
group_models <- df %>%
  group_by(majority_race) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(data, ~lm(Percent_Graduated ~ Median_Household_Income, data = .x)),
    results = map(model, tidy),
    glance = map(model, glance)
  )

# Show regression coefficients
race_results <- group_models %>%
  select(majority_race, results) %>%
  unnest(results)
race_results

# Show model summaries (R², n, etc.)
glance_results <- group_models %>%
  select(majority_race, glance) %>%
  unnest(glance)
glance_results
```

### 2.2.5 Interpretation

Separate linear regression models were estimated for school districts grouped by the majority racial composition of their student population to assess whether the strength of the income–graduation relationship differs across demographic contexts.

In Majority Hispanic districts, the slope coefficient is approximately 0.00112, with a t-statistic of 4.78 and a p-value < 0.001.

In Majority Black districts, the slope is 0.00087, with a t-statistic of 2.41 and a p-value around 0.02.

In Majority White districts, the slope is 0.00035, with a t-statistic of 10.26 and a p-value < 0.001.

All coefficients are positive and statistically significant. The magnitude of the effect is larger in districts with majority Hispanic and Black populations, suggesting potentially greater gains in graduation rates from increases in income in these contexts. for school districts grouped by the majority racial composition of their student population. This approach helps assess whether the strength of the income–graduation relationship differs across demographic contexts.

In Majority Hispanic districts, the slope coefficient indicates the estimated increase in graduation rate associated with a $10,000 increase in household income. The t-statistic and p-value confirm statistical significance, although the sample size may be limited.

In Majority Black districts, the estimated relationship is positive and significant, though subject to greater uncertainty due to smaller group size.

In Majority White districts, the estimated relationship is also positive and statistically significant, with greater stability due to the larger number of observations.

Across all groups, t-statistics suggest the coefficients are distinguishable from zero. While the magnitude varies, the direction of the association remains consistent. These results imply that increases in household income are generally associated with higher graduation outcomes, and that the strength of this effect may be greater in communities with more constrained economic conditions.
