This comes from the file `analysis.qmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis. This page will provide an overview of what questions you addressed, illustrations of relevant aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model that attempts to answer part of the question. You'll also reflect on next steps and further analysis.

The audience for this page is someone like your class mates, so you can expect that they have some level of statistical and quantitative sophistication and understand ideas like linear and logistic regression, coefficients, confidence intervals, overfitting, etc. 

While the exact number of figures and tables will vary and depend on your analysis, you should target around 5 to 6. An overly long analysis could lead to losing points.
If you want you can link back to your blog posts or create separate pages with more details.

The style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. 
I don't expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that aim in mind.
Avoid using "we" too frequently, for example "We also found that ...". Describe your methodology and your findings but don't describe your whole process.

## **2. Simple Regression Analysis**

We begin by estimating a simple linear regression model using total expenditures per pupil as the explanatory variable and graduation rate as the outcome.

### **2.1 Scatterplot and Regression Line**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

df <- readRDS("dataset/Combined_District_Data.rds")

summary(df[, c("Total_Expenditures_Per_Pupil", "Percent_Graduated")])

ggplot(df, aes(x = Total_Expenditures_Per_Pupil, y = Percent_Graduated)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Graduation Rate vs. Total Expenditures Per Pupil",
    x = "Total Expenditures Per Pupil ($)",
    y = "Graduation Rate (%)"
  )
```

###**2.2 Linear Regression Model**

```{r}
model <- lm(Percent_Graduated ~ Total_Expenditures_Per_Pupil, data = df)
summary(model)
```

###**2.3 Interpretation**

A simple linear regression was used to estimate the association between total expenditures per pupil and graduation rates across Massachusetts school districts. The results indicate that every $10,000 increase in per-pupil spending is associated with an increase of approximately 2.3 percentage points in the graduation rate. This effect is statistically significant at conventional levels (p < 0.001), suggesting that the relationship is unlikely to be the result of random variation.

However, the model’s explanatory power is limited. The R-squared value is 0.013, indicating that only 1.3 percent of the variation in graduation rates is explained by differences in per-pupil spending. This suggests that other factors—such as socioeconomic conditions, instructional quality, or school leadership—play a more substantial role in influencing outcomes. While the model reveals a statistically detectable relationship between spending and graduation rates, it remains descriptive. No causal inference can be drawn from these results. The possibility of reverse causality or omitted variable bias must be considered, particularly given that higher-performing districts may receive more funding or that both funding and graduation rates may be influenced by a third variable such as community wealth or political support for education.


###**2.4 Regression by Majority Race Group**

To explore whether the relationship varies by demographic context, we group districts by the majority race of their student population and estimate separate regressions.

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    majority_race = c(
      "White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", 
      "American Indian", "Pacific Islander", "Multi Race"
    )[which.max(c_across(c(
      Percent_White, 
      Percent_Black, 
      Percent_Hispanic, 
      Percent_Asian, 
      Percent_American_Indian, 
      Percent_Pacific_Islander, 
      Percent_Multi_Race
    )))]
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    majority_race = paste("Majority", majority_race)
  )

table(df$majority_race)

library(broom)

group_models <- df %>%
  group_by(majority_race) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(data, ~lm(Percent_Graduated ~ Total_Expenditures_Per_Pupil, data = .x)),
    results = map(model, tidy),
    glance = map(model, glance)
  )

group_models %>%
  select(majority_race, results) %>%
  unnest(results)
```

###**2.5 Interpretation**

Separate linear regression models were estimated for school districts grouped by the majority racial composition of their student population. This approach helps assess whether the strength of the spending–graduation relationship differs across demographic contexts.

In Majority Hispanic districts, the slope coefficient is approximately 0.00135, indicating that a $10,000 increase in per-pupil spending is associated with a 13.5 percentage point increase in graduation rate. The t-statistic is 5.33, and the relationship is statistically significant at the 1 percent level, despite a smaller sample size.

In Majority Black districts, the estimated slope is 0.00062, suggesting a 6.2 percentage point increase in graduation rate per $10,000 spent. This relationship is also statistically significant (t = 2.62, p ≈ 0.012), but the relatively small number of observations (n = 41) reduces precision.

In Majority White districts, which comprise the majority of the sample (n = 3,419), the slope is 0.00029, corresponding to a 2.9 percentage point increase in graduation rate per $10,000 in spending. The t-statistic of 9.94 and very low p-value reflect the stability and statistical strength of this estimate.

The t-statistics measure how far each coefficient lies from zero in terms of standard error units, and they confirm that the positive associations observed are unlikely to occur by chance. Although the strength of the effect varies by group, the direction is consistent, suggesting that increased education funding tends to support higher graduation outcomes across different demographic contexts. Larger effects in Majority Hispanic and Majority Black districts may reflect greater marginal benefits from additional investment in historically underserved areas.

## Rubric: On this page

You will

-   Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
    -   Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
    -   What questions are you interested in answering?
    -   Provide context for the rest of the page. This will include figures/tables that illustrate aspects of the data of your question.
-   Modeling and Inference
    -   The page will include some kind of formal statistical model. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.
    -   Explain the ideas and techniques you used to choose the predictors for your model. (Think about including interaction terms and other transformations of your variables.)
    -   Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
-   Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
    -   Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?
-   Clarity Figures
    -   Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
    -   Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)
    -   Default `lm` output and plots are typically not acceptable.
-   Clarity of Explanations
    -   How well do you explain each figure/result?
    -   Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
-   Organization and cleanliness.
    -   Make sure to remove excessive warnings, hide all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
    -   This page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data.
