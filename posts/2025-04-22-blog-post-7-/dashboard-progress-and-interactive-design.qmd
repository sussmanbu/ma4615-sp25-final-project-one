# Blog Post 7: Dashboard Progress and Interactive Design

Over the past week, we’ve made significant strides on our interactive dashboard for the final project. The goal has been to move beyond static graphs and toward a Shiny application that invites users to explore patterns in Massachusetts graduation data. We've focused on enabling both broad trends and granular insights — two qualities we believe are central to an effective data visualization tool.

### What We’ve Built So Far:

Our current Shiny dashboard includes five primary tabs:

1.  Graduation Overview: A line chart that tracks graduation rate trends across years for a selected district. This offers a high-level view of progress over time, which can help users contextualize local outcomes in historical terms.

2.  Graduation vs. Dropout Rates: A bar chart contrasting the percentage of students who graduate with those who drop out in a given year. This dual view is useful for understanding not just how many succeed, but also where retention gaps may exist.

3.  Income vs. Graduation: An exploratory scatterplot that shows how the proportion of low-income students relates to graduation rates, with filtering by year. This is a powerful tool for detecting equity disparities and long-term socioeconomic effects on academic success.

4.  Demographics: A dynamic bar chart that displays the demographic makeup of the selected district and year. By comparing different student groups, users can start to infer potential structural inequities.

5.  SAT Scores: A simple visualization of mean SAT Reading/Writing and Math scores, which we use to compare college readiness across districts and years.

Above are some screenshots from the dashboard so far.

### Design Philosophy:

As we learned during the in-class activity, a successful interactive should do more than visualize data — it should help the user discover something. We've taken this to heart by integrating Shiny elements like:

-   Sliders to adjust the year and observe trends over time

-   Drop-downs to personalize the district view

-   Hoverable plot elements to reveal district-specific values

-   Linked plots where possible to support comparative exploration

### Next Steps:

While the current dashboard is functional and informative, we recognize there’s more we can do. In the coming days, we plan to introduce additional interactivity and analytical features. Some of these include:

-   A leaflet map to spatially explore regional graduation patterns

-   A “Compare Your District” feature that automatically surfaces similar districts for contextual benchmarking

-   An “Equity Gap Explorer” to quantify subgroup disparities in a single view

By the end of the project, we aim to produce a polished, intuitive, and genuinely insightful dashboard that balances exploration with usability.
