The combined dataset merges county-level graduation data with 2023 income data for the state of Washington. The education dataset includes variables such as graduation rate, dropout counts by year, cohort sizes, and student group identifiers by race and ethnicity. The income dataset provides median household income and associated margin of error for each county. To combine the two datasets, county names were cleaned and standardized to ensure proper matching. This allowed us to join the datasets on a shared county identifier.

By integrating income as an explanatory variable (X), we can begin to examine how economic conditions at the county level may relate to differences in educational outcomes across racial groups. For example, we can analyze whether counties with higher median household incomes tend to have higher graduation rates, and whether these patterns differ by race or student group type. The margin of error provides insight into the precision of the income estimates, which can be used to assess the robustness of our analysis.

Overall, this merged dataset supports exploratory and inferential analysis of how socioeconomic disparities—captured through income—might influence educational attainment, particularly among historically marginalized racial groups in Washington State.
