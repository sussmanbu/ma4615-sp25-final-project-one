This dataset comes from the U.S. Department of Education. It originates from state and district-level education agencies that report graduation rates annually. One such agency is Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction(OSPI), which oversees K-12 public education in Washington State, ensuring compliance with federal and state education policies. The data was collected by the Washington state education department as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) compliance. States are required to report graduation rates as part of their accountability measures. In Washington State, this responsibility falls under OSPI, which manages student demographic data, performance metrics, and school funding information. The original raw data is likely maintained by state education departments or the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Some states, including Washington (via OSPI), publish detailed education reports on their respective government portals.


The dataset represents graduation rates for the 2023-24 academic year and is collected from various organizational levels, including state, county, district, and school levels. One potential issue with data collection is the reliance on self-reported figures from different educational agencies, which may introduce inconsistencies in reporting methods or data accuracy. The sample population consists of students in public schools across different regions, but it may not fully capture private school students, homeschoolers, or alternative education programs, potentially skewing the overall representation of graduation outcomes. Additionally, the dataset may be biased if certain schools or districts have different reporting standards, face underreporting of dropouts, or lack comprehensive tracking systems for student progress. Socioeconomic factors, funding disparities, and policy differences across states and districts could also impact the accuracy and comparability of graduation rates.

The NYC Department of Education's School Attendance and Chronic Absenteeism Data (2016-2021) provides a comprehensive view of student attendance patterns over five academic years, encompassing 53,366 rows and 12 columns. Chronic absenteeism, defined as missing 10% or more of the school year, is a critical indicator of potential academic struggles. Collected through annual school reports, this dataset allows educators and policymakers to analyze attendance trends and identify areas requiring intervention. Key areas of analysis include changes in attendance rates over time, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on chronic absenteeism, and the schools or grade levels facing the most significant attendance challenges. However, the dataset has limitations, as it lacks contextual factors such as socioeconomic background and special education needs, which could provide deeper insights into absenteeism patterns. Additionally, remote learning during the pandemic introduced inconsistencies in attendance tracking across different years. Before conducting a thorough analysis, data cleaning steps such as filling in missing values, standardizing school names, and verifying percentage calculations may be necessary. Despite these challenges, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding attendance trends and developing strategies to improve student engagement and success.
