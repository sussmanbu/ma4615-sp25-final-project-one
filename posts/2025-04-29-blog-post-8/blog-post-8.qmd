Title:
Does Excellence Equal Equity? A Look Inside Massachusetts Public Schools

Thesis:
Massachusetts leads the nation in public education by many measures. But does every student benefit equally from that success? Using public school data from 2006 to 2013, we examine whether outcomes like graduation rates, SAT scores, and access to support services differ by race. Our goal is to understand how opportunity is distributed and whether racial disparities appear in key educational outcomes.

Introduction:
Massachusetts has long played a foundational role in shaping public education in the United States. In 1635, the state established Boston Latin School, recognized as the nation’s first public school. By 1647, it became the first colony to mandate publicly funded schooling for all children through the Massachusetts School Law, often referred to as the "Old Deluder Satan Act." These early milestones reflect a deep and enduring commitment to education as a public good, laying the groundwork for the widespread belief that schools could serve as engines of opportunity and social mobility.

Today, Massachusetts continues to be celebrated for its educational achievements. The state consistently ranks among the top in national assessments, including graduation rates, SAT scores, and performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), often called the "Nation’s Report Card." Many policymakers and educators look to Massachusetts as a model, crediting its reforms in curriculum standards, teacher training, and accountability systems for its success.

However, behind this narrative of excellence lies a more complex and urgent question: does this success extend to all students equally? Massachusetts also has a long history of racial inequality within its education system. In the 1970s, federal court-ordered desegregation efforts in Boston, particularly the controversial busing programs, revealed entrenched divisions along racial and economic lines. Violent protests, white flight from urban public schools, and lasting political battles over school assignments left deep scars. Although schools today no longer operate under the same formal segregation policies, the echoes of those struggles remain visible in residential segregation, school funding patterns, and disparities in school quality across different communities.

These historical legacies raise important questions about the present. Are the benefits of a high-performing education system evenly distributed across racial groups? Or do racial disparities continue to shape student experiences and outcomes, even in a state renowned for its educational leadership?

In this project, we turn to empirical evidence to explore these questions. Using public school data from 2006 to 2013 provided by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, we analyze several key indicators: graduation rates, SAT performance, rates of special education classification, and the proportion of students requiring English language learner (ELL) support. Rather than assuming the existence of inequality, we approach the data with an open, investigative lens. Our aim is to map where disparities, if any, appear, and to better understand how opportunity is distributed within one of the country’s most celebrated public school systems.

To carry out this analysis, we employ multiple regression techniques that allow us to examine the relationship between race and educational outcomes while controlling for other factors such as income level, school district funding, and demographic composition. By using regression models, we can isolate the extent to which race independently predicts variation in graduation rates, SAT scores, and access to special services, beyond what would be expected based on socioeconomic background alone. We also conduct descriptive analyses to summarize raw differences across groups before adjusting for covariates. Through this combined methodological approach, we aim to move beyond surface-level comparisons and provide a more accurate, data-driven understanding of equity within Massachusetts public schools.

Ultimately, by examining both academic outcomes and access to support services with careful statistical methods, we hope to provide a more nuanced picture of equity in Massachusetts public education—highlighting not only the state’s successes but also the persistent challenges that must be addressed if true educational equity is to be realized.

We already completed our shiny tables and had to change course on our second dataset switching to something that was focused on school districts instead of county data as it was much harder to work with the census data as a whole. We think this will allow our data to be more informative and also easier to combine as before it was quite a struggle. Most of the polishing we've worked on is adjusting pictures and making sure there are no spelling mistakes throughout the project
