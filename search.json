    "text": "Report Card Graduation 2023-24 https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/report-card-graduation-2023-24-054a5\nThis dataset provides a comprehensive view of K-12 education outcomes by tracking school year data, district and school identifiers, student demographics, dropout rates, transfer patterns, and graduation rates. Its broad scope across multiple schools and districts offers valuable insights into racial disparities in education, helping to uncover systemic inequities that impact student success. Collected from statewide school reporting systems, the data ensures compliance with federal and state education policies while highlighting variations in graduation rates among racial groups. Cleaning the data may involve addressing missing values, standardizing district and school names, and ensuring consistency in race/ethnicity classifications. Additionally, dropout rates over multiple years may need restructuring for better analysis. This dataset enables the exploration of critical questions, such as how graduation rates differ across racial groups within the same districts, which racial groups have the highest and lowest dropout rates over time, and whether racial disparities in graduation rates are more pronounced in certain states or districts.\nattendance rates in Connecticut https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-attendance-by-student-group-and-district-2021-2022\nThis data set explores attendance rates in Connecticut during the 2021-2022 school year. It contains 12 columns and 2020 rows, some of which include attendance rates, the name of the school, and student groups. Data collection seems to have been done by each school individually likely to explore the effect COVID-19 had on the school attendance rates as it compares previous years to the ones in which school closures had a major impact. The student groups category includes students with disabilities, students suffering from homelessness, and students of different races. This could lead to problems with cleaning and formatting the data as these different groups are all included in the same column. Hopefully this data can be used to explore differences in attendance rates by race and maybe explore other factors in schools, for example need based factors by race. A challenge with this data set is it doesn’t provide much information behind attendance rates and demographic information of the student body. If it were possible to combine this information with test scores or some other academic factor it would likely be a much more intriguing data source to use.\nThe NYC Department of Education’s School Attendance and Chronic Absenteeism Data https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2016-17-2020-21-school-end-of-year-attendance-and-chronic-absenteeism-data"

    "section": "The NYC Department of Education’s School Attendance and Chronic Absenteeism Data (2016-2021) provides insights into student attendance patterns over five school years, tracking total school days, absences, percentage attendance, and chronic absenteeism rates across 53,366 rows and 12 columns. Chronic absenteeism, defined as missing 10% or more of the school year, can indicate deeper academic struggles. Collected through annual school reports, this data helps educators and policymakers identify attendance trends and address factors affecting student success. Key questions for analysis include how attendance rates have changed over time, whether chronic absenteeism worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, and which schools or grade levels face the greatest challenges. However, the dataset lacks background details like socioeconomic status or special education needs, limiting context for observed trends. Additionally, remote learning introduced inconsistencies in attendance tracking across years. Before analysis, data cleaning may involve filling in missing values, standardizing school names, and verifying percentage calculations. Despite these challenges, the dataset serves as a valuable foundation for understanding attendance patterns and developing strategies to keep students engaged in school.",

The combined data set we had complied all different group types of students into a single column so to fix this we used pivot wider to expand the table with all of these different group types.

    "text": "The combined dataset merges county-level graduation data with 2023 income data for the state of Washington. The education dataset includes variables such as graduation rate, dropout counts by year, cohort sizes, and student group identifiers by race and ethnicity. The income dataset provides median household income and associated margin of error for each county. To combine the two datasets, county names were cleaned and standardized to ensure proper matching. This allowed us to join the datasets on a shared county identifier.\n\nBy integrating income as an explanatory variable (X), we can begin to examine how economic conditions at the county level may relate to differences in educational outcomes across racial groups. For example, we can analyze whether counties with higher median household incomes tend to have higher graduation rates, and whether these patterns differ by race or student group type. The margin of error provides insight into the precision of the income estimates, which can be used to assess the robustness of our analysis.\n\nOverall, this merged dataset supports exploratory and inferential analysis of how socioeconomic disparities—captured through income—might influence educational attainment, particularly among historically marginalized racial groups in Washington State."

    "text": "Title: Does Excellence Equal Equity? A Look Inside Massachusetts Public Schools\nThesis: Massachusetts leads the nation in public education by many measures. But does every student benefit equally from that success? Using public school data from 2006 to 2013, we examine whether outcomes like graduation rates, SAT scores, and access to support services differ by race. Our goal is to understand how opportunity is distributed and whether racial disparities appear in key educational outcomes.\nIntroduction: Massachusetts has long played a foundational role in shaping public education in the United States. In 1635, the state established Boston Latin School, recognized as the nation’s first public school. By 1647, it became the first colony to mandate publicly funded schooling for all children through the Massachusetts School Law, often referred to as the “Old Deluder Satan Act.” These early milestones reflect a deep and enduring commitment to education as a public good, laying the groundwork for the widespread belief that schools could serve as engines of opportunity and social mobility.\nToday, Massachusetts continues to be celebrated for its educational achievements. The state consistently ranks among the top in national assessments, including graduation rates, SAT scores, and performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), often called the “Nation’s Report Card.” Many policymakers and educators look to Massachusetts as a model, crediting its reforms in curriculum standards, teacher training, and accountability systems for its success.\nHowever, behind this narrative of excellence lies a more complex and urgent question: does this success extend to all students equally? Massachusetts also has a long history of racial inequality within its education system. In the 1970s, federal court-ordered desegregation efforts in Boston, particularly the controversial busing programs, revealed entrenched divisions along racial and economic lines. Violent protests, white flight from urban public schools, and lasting political battles over school assignments left deep scars. Although schools today no longer operate under the same formal segregation policies, the echoes of those struggles remain visible in residential segregation, school funding patterns, and disparities in school quality across different communities.\nThese historical legacies raise important questions about the present. Are the benefits of a high-performing education system evenly distributed across racial groups? Or do racial disparities continue to shape student experiences and outcomes, even in a state renowned for its educational leadership?\nIn this project, we turn to empirical evidence to explore these questions. Using public school data from 2006 to 2013 provided by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, we analyze several key indicators: graduation rates, SAT performance, rates of special education classification, and the proportion of students requiring English language learner (ELL) support. Rather than assuming the existence of inequality, we approach the data with an open, investigative lens. Our aim is to map where disparities, if any, appear, and to better understand how opportunity is distributed within one of the country’s most celebrated public school systems.\nTo carry out this analysis, we employ multiple regression techniques that allow us to examine the relationship between race and educational outcomes while controlling for other factors such as income level, school district funding, and demographic composition. By using regression models, we can isolate the extent to which race independently predicts variation in graduation rates, SAT scores, and access to special services, beyond what would be expected based on socioeconomic background alone. We also conduct descriptive analyses to summarize raw differences across groups before adjusting for covariates. Through this combined methodological approach, we aim to move beyond surface-level comparisons and provide a more accurate, data-driven understanding of equity within Massachusetts public schools.\nUltimately, by examining both academic outcomes and access to support services with careful statistical methods, we hope to provide a more nuanced picture of equity in Massachusetts public education—highlighting not only the state’s successes but also the persistent challenges that must be addressed if true educational equity is to be realized."

    "text": "We are currently finalizing a comprehensive dataset that compiles district-level information spanning 18 years (2006–2023), with a particular focus on academic outcomes such as SAT performance, graduation rates, enrollment demographics, low-income percentages, and teacher-to-student ratios. To ensure consistency across this panel, we standardized district names and aligned year columns before merging graduation data with enrollment figures for each year. Additionally, SAT performance data was incorporated by matching district and year, with SAT scores appended only where districts already existed in the core panel. Empty cells were replaced with the placeholder “nil” to maintain clarity during downstream processing.\nOur cleaned dataset, titled final_merged, includes detailed insights into how various factors—such as income levels, school resources, and demographic shifts—may influence student achievement across districts. We also created a filtered version of this dataset by excluding charter schools to focus exclusively on traditional public schools. One key column, “Low Income %,” reflects the proportion of students from low-income households in each district, which we anticipate will be useful in identifying patterns between socioeconomic background and academic success. Moving forward, this dataset enables us to explore broader questions about the relationship between school funding, equity in education, and academic performance over time, positioning it as a strong foundation for longitudinal and policy-oriented analysis."

    "text": "This week we filtered the dataset we have, focusing on making sure we can fit it together with another dataset, hopefully census data. The main problem we faced was the district data included Charter Schools, Technical Schools, Vocational Schools, and Argricultural Schools. We had to remove all of these for two reasons, it would be difficult to locate all of these schools and merge them with their actual town data and two many of these schools admit students from around the state, mainly around their town. This may lead to students that aren’t from the town being included in this dataset but not the census data. As a result of this issue we found it was best to just remove these schools and miss out on some data as we are really only looking at public school data. One thing to note is many of these schools had a more diverse student body so missing out on them will likely lead our data to be less intriguing but it’s a sacrifice that has to be made to properly fit the two datasets together.\nFurthermore, we included income as an additional predictor, though this required extra steps since average income by school district wasn’t directly available. To approximate it, we matched school districts to their corresponding counties and used U.S. Census county-level income data. Including income is important because it can help explain differences in educational outcomes. Students in lower-income areas may face barriers that impact access, resources, and performance. This variable further adds to our characteristics group, allowing us to better capture the structural and demographic factors influencing educational equity."

    "text": "This dataset comes from the U.S. Department of Education. It originates from state and district-level education agencies that report graduation rates annually. One such agency is Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction(OSPI), which oversees K-12 public education in Washington State, ensuring compliance with federal and state education policies. The data was collected by the Washington state education department as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) compliance. States are required to report graduation rates as part of their accountability measures. In Washington State, this responsibility falls under OSPI, which manages student demographic data, performance metrics, and school funding information. The original raw data is likely maintained by state education departments or the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Some states, including Washington (via OSPI), publish detailed education reports on their respective government portals.\nThe dataset represents graduation rates for the 2023-24 academic year and is collected from various organizational levels, including state, county, district, and school levels. One potential issue with data collection is the reliance on self-reported figures from different educational agencies, which may introduce inconsistencies in reporting methods or data accuracy. The sample population consists of students in public schools across different regions, but it may not fully capture private school students, homeschoolers, or alternative education programs, potentially skewing the overall representation of graduation outcomes. Additionally, the dataset may be biased if certain schools or districts have different reporting standards, face underreporting of dropouts, or lack comprehensive tracking systems for student progress. Socioeconomic factors, funding disparities, and policy differences across states and districts could also impact the accuracy and comparability of graduation rates.\nThe NYC Department of Education’s School Attendance and Chronic Absenteeism Data (2016-2021) provides a comprehensive view of student attendance patterns over five academic years, encompassing 53,366 rows and 12 columns. Chronic absenteeism, defined as missing 10% or more of the school year, is a critical indicator of potential academic struggles. Collected through annual school reports, this dataset allows educators and policymakers to analyze attendance trends and identify areas requiring intervention. Key areas of analysis include changes in attendance rates over time, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on chronic absenteeism, and the schools or grade levels facing the most significant attendance challenges. However, the dataset has limitations, as it lacks contextual factors such as socioeconomic background and special education needs, which could provide deeper insights into absenteeism patterns. Additionally, remote learning during the pandemic introduced inconsistencies in attendance tracking across different years. Before conducting a thorough analysis, data cleaning steps such as filling in missing values, standardizing school names, and verifying percentage calculations may be necessary. Despite these challenges, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding attendance trends and developing strategies to improve student engagement and success."

Its broad scope across multiple schools and districts offers valuable insights into racial disparities in education, helping to uncover systemic inequities that impact student success. Collected from statewide school reporting systems, the data ensures compliance with federal and state education policies while highlighting variations in graduation rates among racial groups. Cleaning the data may involve addressing missing values, standardizing district and school names, and ensuring consistency in race/ethnicity classifications. Additionally, dropout rates over multiple years may need restructuring for better analysis. This dataset enables the exploration of critical questions, such as how graduation rates differ across racial groups within the same districts, which racial groups have the highest and lowest dropout rates over time, and whether racial disparities in graduation rates are more pronounced in certain states or districts.\nAttendance rates in Connecticut https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-attendance-by-student-group-and-district-2021-2022\nThis data set explores attendance rates in Connecticut during the 2021-2022 school year. It contains 12 columns and 2020 rows, some of which include attendance rates, the name of the school, and student groups. Data collection seems to have been done by each school individually likely to explore the effect COVID-19 had on the school attendance rates as it compares previous years to the ones in which school closures had a major impact. The student groups category includes students with disabilities, students suffering from homelessness, and students of different races. This could lead to problems with cleaning and formatting the data as these different groups are all included in the same column. Hopefully this data can be used to explore differences in attendance rates by race and maybe explore other factors in schools, for example need based factors by race. A challenge with this data set is it doesn’t provide much information behind attendance rates and demographic information of the student body. If it were possible to combine this information with test scores or some other academic factor it would likely be a much more intriguing data source to use.\nThe NYC Department of Education’s School Attendance and Chronic Absenteeism Data https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2016-17-2020-21-school-end-of-year-attendance-and-chronic-absenteeism-data\nThe NYC Department of Education’s School Attendance and Chronic Absenteeism Data (2016-2021) provides insights into student attendance patterns over five school years, tracking total school days, absences, percentage attendance, and chronic absenteeism rates across 53,366 rows and 12 columns. Chronic absenteeism, defined as missing 10% or more of the school year, can indicate deeper academic struggles. Collected through annual school reports, this data helps educators and policymakers identify attendance trends and address factors affecting student success. Key questions for analysis include how attendance rates have changed over time, whether chronic absenteeism worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, and which schools or grade levels face the greatest challenges. However, the dataset lacks background details like socioeconomic status or special education needs, limiting context for observed trends. Additionally, remote learning introduced inconsistencies in attendance tracking across years. Before analysis, data cleaning may involve filling in missing values, standardizing school names, and verifying percentage calculations. Despite these challenges, the dataset serves as a valuable foundation for understanding attendance patterns and developing strategies to keep students engaged in school."

The goal has been to move beyond static graphs and toward a Shiny application that invites users to explore patterns in Massachusetts graduation data. We’ve focused on enabling both broad trends and granular insights — two qualities we believe are central to an effective data visualization tool.\n\nWhat We’ve Built So Far:\nOur current Shiny dashboard includes five primary tabs:\n\nGraduation Overview: A line chart that tracks graduation rate trends across years for a selected district. This offers a high-level view of progress over time, which can help users contextualize local outcomes in historical terms.\nGraduation vs. Dropout Rates: A bar chart contrasting the percentage of students who graduate with those who drop out in a given year. This dual view is useful for understanding not just how many succeed, but also where retention gaps may exist.\nIncome vs. Graduation: An exploratory scatterplot that shows how the proportion of low-income students relates to graduation rates, with filtering by year. This is a powerful tool for detecting equity disparities and long-term socioeconomic effects on academic success.\nDemographics: A dynamic bar chart that displays the demographic makeup of the selected district and year. By comparing different student groups, users can start to infer potential structural inequities.\nSAT Scores: A simple visualization of mean SAT Reading/Writing and Math scores, which we use to compare college readiness across districts and years.\n\n\n\nAbove are some screenshots from the dashboard so far.\n\n\nDesign Philosophy:\nAs we learned during the in-class activity, a successful interactive should do more than visualize data — it should help the user discover something. We’ve taken this to heart by integrating Shiny elements like:\n\nSliders to adjust the year and observe trends over time\nDrop-downs to personalize the district view\nHoverable plot elements to reveal district-specific values\nLinked plots where possible to support comparative exploration\n\n\n\nNext Steps:\nWhile the current dashboard is functional and informative, we recognize there’s more we can do. In the coming days, we plan to introduce additional interactivity and analytical features. Some of these include:\n\nA leaflet map to spatially explore regional graduation patterns\nA “Compare Your District” feature that automatically surfaces similar districts for contextual benchmarking\nAn “Equity Gap Explorer” to quantify subgroup disparities in a single view\n\nBy the end of the project, we aim to produce a polished, intuitive, and genuinely insightful dashboard that balances exploration with usability."

It includes data on student enrollment, academic performance, graduation rates, and demographics of the student body. It offers district-level information spanning 18 years (2006–2023). The data was compiled to guide educational improvement and support policies and programs. To ensure consistency across this panel, we standardized district names and aligned year columns before merging graduation data with enrollment figures for each year. Additionally, SAT performance data was incorporated by matching district and year, with SAT scores appended only where districts already existed in the core panel. Empty cells were replaced with the placeholder “nil” to maintain clarity during downstream processing.\n\n\nLayout\nThe main variables focused on in this dataset were demographics of the student body. In total there are 24 unique variables, of these 7 are very infulential to our research.\n\nYear: Year\nDistrict Name: Name of each school district\nPerecent_Graduated: Graduation rates for the given school district in each year\n2 Main Race variables:\n\nPerecent_Black: Percentage of student body that identifies as being Black\nPercent_White: Percentage of student body that identifies as being White\n\nSAT_Reading_Writing_Mean_Score: Average Reading and Writing SAT score for school district in a given year\nSAT_Math_Mean_Score: Average Math SAT score for school district in a given year\nLow_Income_Percent: Indicates the proportion of students enrolled who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, based on state or federal criteria.\n\n\n\nCleaning Processs\nCleaning Script\nThe code executes the following operations:\n\nLoads the data from final_merged_no_charter.csv located in the dataset directory.\nRemoves all Technical, Vocational, Agricultural, and Virtual schools from the dataset.\nChanged ‘nil’ values to 0\nRearranges the dataset to list schools by district alphabetically and by year.\nRecodes the variable names to be easier to understand and work with.\nSaves the cleaned dataset to massachusetts_district_data.rds in the dataset directory.\n\nSome things to note, all charter, technical, vocational, agricultural, and virtual schools were removed from the dataset. When combining this dataset with another it felt prudent to remove charter schools as people from outside the school district can attend these schools. Likewise other school types that weren’t strictly public were removed to make the combination process more efficient.\n\n\nDataset Visualizations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset 2: Massachusetts Per Pupil Expenditure\n\nSource\nLink to dataset\nThis dataset is also provided by the Massachusetts Department of Education and Secondary Education. It provides data and analysis related to per-pupil expenditures, the amount of money spent per student, across school districts in Massachusetts. Per-pupil expenditures are calculated by dividing a district’s operating costs by its average pupil membership (FTEs), including in-district expenditures per pupil and total expenditures per pupil, which include in-district and out-of-district spending and enrollment. This data helps policymakers, educators, and the public compare spending patterns and evaluate how educational funds are allocated and used across the state.\n\n\nLayout\nThis data set contains 9 variables of which 4 are influential to our study.\n-Year: Year -District Name: Name of each school district -Total_Expenditures: Total expenditures for each school district per year -Total_Expenditures_Per_Pupil: Total expenditures per student for each school district per year.\n\n\nCleaning Processs\nCleaning Script\nThe code executes the following operations:\n\nSet up and locate files in the dataset directory, Filters to include only files with names like PerPupilExpenditures_YYYY.rds.\nMakes the first row the column names, then drops first row.\nFilters out Charter, Vocational, and Technical schools as well as state totals.\nEnsures a consistent layout for year.\nRenames columns for consistency with dataset 1.\nSaves the cleaned dataset to PerPupilExpenditures_combined_filtered.rds in the dataset directory.\n\nOne thing to note is the datasets were individual per year and had to be combined into one larger dataset that had all years instead of being separate. #### Dataset Visualizations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerged Dataset\nThe merged dataset combines all variables from massachusets_district_data.rds and PerPupilExpenditures_combined_filtered.rds.\n\nMerging the data\nMerging Script\nThe code executres the following operations:\n\nLoads the datasets massachusets_district_data.rds and PerPupilExpenditures_combined_filtered.rds from the dataset directory\nCleans data in massachusets_district_data.rdsConverts the “District Name” column to lowercase (tolower()) to ensure uniformity in case sensitivity. Converts the “Year” column to an integer (as.integer()) to make sure it’s in a proper numeric format for analysis.\nCleans the PerPupilExpenditures_combined_filtered.rds to convert “District Name” to lower case and “Year” to be an integer.\nDeletes one of the District Code columns.\nMerges the datasets and saves them to the dataset directory.\n\n\n\nData Visulizations"
